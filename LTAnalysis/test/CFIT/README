===== ABOUT

  CFIT is a package to perform a template fit with incorporating
  systematic uncertainties in a correlation matrix. Systematic
  correlations between templates and bin-by-bin correlations in the
  fitted variable are taken into account. The method has been proposed
  in CMS AN-14-069, for more details on the method please see the note.

===== INSTALL

  > make
  
===== RUN

  CFIT usage could be seen in example test.C. To run the tool do:

  > root run.C
  
  This will print out the result chi2/ndof along with the fitted
  parameters and its uncertainties. Two image files are additionally
  created: sys.eps (fractional systematic uncertainties) and
  result.eps (fitted templates with data histogram)
  
  There are two example input files to illustrate the work of
  the tool: input1.root (one template fit) and input2.root (3-template fit)
